                        <p class="card-text">This position carries all the responsibilities of my previous position, and the extra responsibilities of; Coordinating and implementing staff training.  Planning and managing the restaurant.  Seating and greeting guests and ensuring their needs are met.  While in this position I came up with some new ideas to help the owners make their businesses more socially aware.  For example, I made use of the televisions in the bar areas as a form of an advertising tool for both hotels.  This was achieved by the use of a Raspberry Pi by creating a computer package which included photographs of the hotel facilities and information on up and coming events for both hotels.  This was successful as it increased revenue in both hotels as people were not aware that they had a sister hotel with a function suite.  I have recently downsized to a smaller 'Raspberry Pi Zero'.  The advantage of running a 'Raspberry Pi Zero' is that I can use the power from the TV USB and have no unsightly wires showing.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">My new duties where to shadow the owner on reception so as to help increase my understanding, that would lead me to increasing occupancy.  This would involve learning the new online booking system so that I could be responisble for it when the manager finishes her shift.  Another responsibility I was given was to order wet stock for the bar, and to maintain the bar area and cellar to a high standard.  While in my new position I decided to learn the back-office software, to see what capabilities it had for increasing the business.  This led to me taking on the role of stock taker.  I performed this as a learning role, to see if it was viable and then to stop using professional stock takers.  In this role, I would perform weekly wet stocktaking for both hotels.  I checked the stock and comprised a report to identify any discrepancies in the gross profit percentage this also decreased the wastage and increased profits by; -> Real life pricing, -> Identified good and poor stock items, -> Reduced wastage, -> Categorised what correct stock levels should be, and to reduce holding stocks.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">I was employed originally on a trial basis at the Shard Riverside Inn.   On my second day working with the owner on reception, I suggested a better way for him to cash up his till and keep track of his end of day sales.  I did this by creating a spreadsheet to make the business more efficient.  After my trial period I was transferred to a full-time position at their sister hotel at The Mill at Condor Green. The team included six members of staff.</p>
