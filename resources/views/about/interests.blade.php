                            lined that up for my next project. I could hopefully learn enough to build an app, that I
                            could use on my VR Quest.</p>

                            hand at recording my own battles with 99 other people. I would do a screen recording on my
                            mobile phone and then transfer the recording to my laptop. I would then edit the video using
                            iMovie, learning how to use iMovie in the process. After I was happy with the finished
                            product, I would then upload it to YouTube.</p>

                            automatic blinds, smart door locks, and lights. I have a few smart home devices, but I
                            haven't chosen a specific brand because they offer different functions.</p>
